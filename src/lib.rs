//! This crate is a helper to quickly construct a CSP and then turn it into a
//! String.
//!
//! This library can help you when you don't want to remember some weird
//! formatting rules of CSP, and want to avoid typos. And it certainly can be
//! handy if you need to re-use things, for example a list of sources (just
//! .clone() them everywhere and you're good to go!).
//!
//! WARNING: this library does not care if you create invalid CSP rules, and
//! happily allows them and turns them into Strings. But it does force you to
//! use a typed structure, so it'll be harder to mess up than when manually
//! writing CSP. Another thing that this crate does not do: It does not do any
//! base64 or percent encoding or anything like that.
//!
//! # Example usage
//! ```rust
//! use csp::{CSP, Directive, Sources, Source};
//!
//! let csp = CSP::new()
//!   .push(Directive::ImgSrc(
//!     Sources::new_with(Source::Self_)
//!       .push(Source::Host("https://*.example.org"))
//!       .push(Source::Host("https://shields.io")),
//!   ))
//!   .push(Directive::ConnectSrc(
//!     Sources::new()
//!       .push(Source::Host("http://crates.io"))
//!       .push(Source::Scheme("https"))
//!       .push(Source::Self_),
//!   ))
//!   .push(Directive::StyleSrc(
//!     Sources::new_with(Source::Self_).push(Source::UnsafeInline),
//!   ))
//!   .push(Directive::ObjectSrc(Sources::new()));
//!
//! let csp_header = "Content-Security-Policy: ".to_owned() + &csp.to_string();
//! ```
